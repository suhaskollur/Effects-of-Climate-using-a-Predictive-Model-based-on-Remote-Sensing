# Effects of Climate using a Predictive Model based on Remote Sensing

Abstract—Human-induced climate change is causing unpredictable changes around the world to global economies and people's way of living. We present a study undertaken on the prediction of three parameters that quantify climate change, namely Land Surface Temperature, Carbon Monoxide Concentration and Precipitation. Since the three parameters are essentially non stationary in nature, the differencing method has been looked at to fine tune the output of the prediction models. The two seasonal auto-regressive models chosen for the study are Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and TBATS, due to non-stationarity of the data. The focus is to predict climate change using predictive models for Indian Subcontinent. Region wise dataset were extracted from Google Earth Engine using a reducer. A comparison of the forecasting models using Root Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Scaled Error suggests that SARIMA performs better in the case of Land Surface Temperature and Precipitation whereas TBATS performs better for Carbon Monoxide Concentration.

The main objective of this project is to predict the future values of various climate parameters such as Land Surface Temperature, Carbon Monoxide Emissions, and Precipitation. We intend to design a predictive algorithm and Quality Assessment and Analysis of projected results.

Human-induced climate change is changing global weather patterns, causing glacial retreats, and increasing the surface temperatures on land. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are prolificating.

Rapid environmental change is causing food and water scarcity, while some species are pushed into extinction due to environmental collapse. The effects of a changing climate can be seen in the areas that we value and rely on, such as water, energy, wildlife, and human health.

If climate change is not monitored effectively then it would lead us to a serious situation. This project aims to quantify the effects of human-induced climate change via remote sensing techniques.

Future scenarios that are affected by climate change are not inevitable. We already know a multitude of issues and solutions, and continuing research on these impacts keeps generating new ideas.

We are using SARIMA model to predict a few climate parameters such as Land Surface Temperature (LST), Carbon Monoxide (CO) Concentration and Precipitation.
